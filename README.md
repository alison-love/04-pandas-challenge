In this project, we are tasked with compiling and analyzing two sets of data collected by Py City Schools. The data received pertains to the district’s schools (the type, the size, and the budget allocated), and the district’s students’ standardized test scores. The purpose of this analysis is to aggregate the data and look for trends in school performance in order to make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

In analyzing this data, I found several patterns that would be of interest to the school districts:

1. All 5 top-performing schools were charter schools, and all 5 bottom-performing schools were district schools.
   *Would like more data on the structure of charter schools vs. district schools: class size, class structure, teacher salaries

4. As spending per student increases, passing scores decrease.

5. Large schools have significantly lower passing rates than small and medium-sized schools.

6. Math scores and math passing rates are consistently lower than reading. Even more-so in bottom-performing schools than top-performing schools.

Overall, in this analysis we can clearly see that charter schools are out-performing district schools across the board, large schools tend to have lower passing rates, and per-student spending does not seem to have a positive effect on test scores.
